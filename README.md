Like every year I try to participate *(and not give up)* to the yearly Advent of Code. Since I am currently learning Rust I've decided this year to fully make it in Rust

This is the first time I make my AoC repository public, therefore expect this:
- I **won't smash my keyboard at 6am** *(my time when daily challenge is published)*
- I may **skip one day and do it the next day** *(I still have other things to do)*
- It **won't be the best code but it will work** *(I will try to code it as good as I can)*
- I might **stop doing it in the middle of the month**, as my brain is not big enough to even understand some challenges
